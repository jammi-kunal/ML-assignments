"Be wary of the wired headphones. Very poor quality control - the item I received had a defective jack - doesn't work on any device when fully inserted - has to be a 'jugaad' - half-inserted, jiggling that varies from device to device. There is also a crackling (distortion) in the audio. The ""clever"" ploy is that there's no refund on the product - only an exchange - so no guarantee I'll receive a better item next time.

But to be fair, when it works, the sound is very good - good treble, heavy bass - I wish they had better QC for all the parts.
btw, I didn't find it tight or sweaty - comfortable fit for a normal sized head - and ambient sound(s) are almost inaudible, so that's great.",1.0 out of 5 stars

Edit: 4 months update: Working well as it was on Day 1. No issues for now

Edit 2: 5 month update. Many issue can be seen. Voice leakage. Others next to you can listen to the music you are listening to easily. The jack has become loose and need to adjust it sometimes on phone or laptop to listen clearly. Downgrading my raring from 4 to 2.",2.0 out of 5 stars
Hi everyone... I bought this headphones after going through so many +ve reviews.... I really wonder how this headphones garnered this many +ve reviews... Now coming to the headphones... my earlier Sennheiser PX80 headphones were damaged after using for 4 years and searching online for a good quality headphones and I ordered this.. However at the very initial use I found the quality is too far inferior to my previous headphones and definitely this headphones not on the lighter side and one feels really heavier... About sound quality it is hardly matching to my previous headphones... Dear BOAT please note this 'Bass' is not everything in the music... A headphone quality depends how it clearly denotes the even the smallest quote of the music... So if some looking for a quality music then I dont recommend this... If you want some cheap loud bass at the cost of quality of the music then it is your choice...,1.0 out of 5 stars

All boat products are designed to work for about 10 months to 1 year....Then it collapses. Waste of money.
