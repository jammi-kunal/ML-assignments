"Would not recommend these headphones: the earpads are made out of leather and the headphones are too tight.

This leads to the leather being pushed against your ears with quite a lot of force. Although decently comfortable at first, it quickly becomes uncomfortable; your ears start paining.

Since this is leather, your ears' heat is quickly absorbed by the leather too. In around 5-10 mins, it becomes very warm due to your body heat, making it even more uncomfortable to wear. There is a noticeable difference in temperature when you take it off for a few minutes and then wear it again.

So if you wear it for more than 20 mins, you can expect your ears to hurt a lot, and also be a few degrees hotter than the rest of your body (which doesn't help with the pain).

It could've been a 5/5, recommendable product. But, due to the aforementioned problems, it's become a 3/5 and non-recommendable due to how uncomfortable it is to wear for extended periods of time.

The hinge is also subpar; it's a little plastic that can easily wear out. After a few minutes of turn the cups around, it wore away enough to the point where it no longer works",3.0 out of 5 stars
"For the price you're paying, don't expect some 'beats by dre' type of sound quality, it's just decent all around. Good for watching movies and playing games, but it's not that comfortable if you're a person who wears glasses, but it's still good nonetheless.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"As I've ignored the reviews that it will Stop working after 2-3 months, I've purchased this product on 8tg July and it stopped working in August. 2 mahine bhi nai chala sahi se .

"I have been using this for almost a year now. Sound quality is superb. The build quality is also nice. Ear pads are soft , for which it is comfortable for long duration uses .
The main disadvantage is that, Mic does not work properly. I purchased this product for attending meetings over team. At the beginning only , The Mic was not efficient, my voice was very feeble. After 3-4 months, mic completely stopped working.

"If you are looking for an economical yet good pair of headphones you can go ahead with these without hesitation.
I bought these headphones because I was tired of the small in-ear earphones I had and getting irritated using them for a good period of time. These headphones are light and comfortable. Also the style is pretty good. For the price, it is a great value.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"The headphones are alright, the sound quality and bass is ok.
But you can't wear that for very long because the headphones keep pushing your ears. After around 15-20 mins your ears will begin to hurt.
Also, while attempting to wear the headphones if that slips, will directly hit your eye.
Mic is also bad, unless you hold the mic close to your mouth the voice wouldn't be clear.
I wouldn't recommend at any price.

Moreover, the warranty that you get from Boat is useless unless your house is very close to their service center. Their customer care never responds. The service centers are located so far away that you'll need to spend more money in travelling than the price of the product.
Highly disappointed in Boat.",2.0 out of 5 stars

"I am writing this review after using it for one month. The headphone is nice in design, looks, bass us awesome and noise cancellation is also good. The only von side of this product is if you is for more than 1 or 1.5 hours you will feel little pain in the ear otherwise this product is very good for music, office work like calls etc.
Also, the metal jack is awesome because of which there is no tension of wire getting cut at the joint . So overall in this price it is a good product.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"I love this headphone. Got it for 599. Totally worth for the money. Sound quality is so nice. Every background sounds could be heard accurately. I was surprised at first about how accurate it is. Because I am hearing something that I haven't without this darling and it was so pleasant. The mic and the button on it come handy. Compatible with both my laptop and phone.

Many reviews told that ot was tight and had to do something to loosen up. But I find it most comfortable. You might experience a little pain in ear if you use it for long hours (like more than 6 hours continuously) in beginning. But I don't have that issue anymore.

The price too changes often with the offers. If you are searching for a overhead earphone in nominal price go for it. I'm using it for about 3 months. Absolutely in loving with it.",5.0 out of 5 stars

"Hey, I'm new to headphones. I'm a headset fan actually. This time I wanna try something different since my old headset's wire got damaged.( I used to listen to songs while asleep)
So I find this interesting cuz they've mentioned it's foldable and braided. And headphones looks cooler than headsets. You know people can't notice headset s since they're small and headphones looks bigger and everyone will notice :p
So I ordered it two days ago. It's too bad now this headphone is available in lighting sale in much cheaper price. I bought it for 799 now it's 699/-
OK. Let's come to my review. I was excited since it's my first headphone but it's too bad I had exams so I had to wait until noon. After the 6 hours of experimentation... I didn't wear this 6 hours though.
I decided not to buy headphones again. It's not headphones it's my ears. God, I feel so uncomfortable and it causes pain in my ears after 10 mins of usage. Even though I used it in 6/10 volume it cause me severe pain in my ears.
Music n base is crystal clear n really good. But it's not my comfort zone. I think I have a small ear. I always used to wear small buds in in-ear types. Cuz it's the correct fit for me.it causing me a pain even tough there is a cushion.
Cushion supposed to give us comfort, But it kinda causing pain. May be because cusion is only available for corner. The best thing about in-ear headphones is noise isolation. Even a Chinese brand in-ear provide good noise isolation. But it doesn't. I can clearly hear everything around me.
It's braided as it says. Some youtubers frightened me, by saying it's not braided. But it's braided. It's wire is almost 3 mm thick so I think it's braided. And they provide you a spring which prevents breaking.
But like I said quality doesn't matters when it affects our comfort level.",3.0 out of 5 stars

"I brought this headphone for 750 Rupees. It's really easy to use and I like the sound quality of it. but the only one negativity is that it's very lightweight so from my point of view it can break very easily so should not put it down.
They gave this headphones with one year of warranty card so let's see how long it will be in good condition!! .and one more thing that It has good ratings and more then 30 thousand people brought this products that's why I believe it and brought it .( when its gets problem or not working that time I will update again about this headphones ) otherwise value for money.",4.0 out of 5 stars

"Packaging was good. Nice and compact. I received my order earlier than expected. Sound quality is really good for such a small budget. The wire is really long but springy, so sometimes it feels a bit curled up which can obstruct when typing. Only issue is that it is loose on my head. I have tried several overhead headphones and they all fit my head although some were a bit too tight, that was resolved by extending the overhead. But with this one, its already loose so I dont know how to make it sit on my head snugly without extending beyond my earlobes. Thats why the 4 star rating. :)",4.0 out of 5 stars
"Good product overall, but the ear pads are too large and the sponge is a bit unbreathable, comparing to Motorola Pulse 2 at similar proce point , clearly my preference would be Motorola Pulse 2 over this product.
I also feel a bit heavy/louder sound on the right earpiece compared to left one. But that might be clearly a problem with my hearing.
I miss the feature of a completely detachable and replacable headphone cable in this product , which is present in the pulse 2 which makes it really convenient for repairs and long life. If the cable is damaged in pulse 2 you can simple buy an aux cable and you headphone will be good as new. Also the detachable feature protecs the cable from tearing in case of a sudden jolt as the cable simply unplugs in motorola pulse 2.
I wish this feature will abe also available in boat headphones soon enough and that they also make thw ear pads more soft and breathable for extra comfort.",3.0 out of 5 stars

"Sound Quality is actually pretty good and bass is also good. However I noticed that when I played music in a slightly higher volume, sound could be heard outside the headphones and everyone understood that I was listening to music (which was embarrassing in certain situations lol). This adds to my point that the noise cancellation isn't perfect. Also, the headphones are like extremely tight so you get ear pain after using for more than an hour or two. Otherwise an average product which is justified for the price.",3.0 out of 5 stars

"Very good sound quality. Excellent bass. Perfect headphones for this price for any PUBG player. It gives clear sound and also headphones vibrates when you shoot or getting shot at.

"I have now used it for one year. Great value for money product.

Sound: 10/10. The sound quality of this headphone is amazing and on par with many expensive ones. Bass is amazing, it feels very natural. Lows, highs, mids and vocals are perfectly balanced. It is great for playing games as well.

Durability: 10/10. The wire of the headphone is very thick and tangle free. I have dropped it a few times from my bed and there isn't any visible damage or scratches.

Comfort: 7.5/10. When continuously using for 3-4 hours you may feel a little pain on your ears because of the pads. But I think that's a general issue with budget headphones. Also you can't run around wearing these. It is quite uncomfortable to do so.

Mic: 6/10. The mic is actually below average. There is no noise cancellation. My mic sometimes doesn't even work(I have this issue for the past 2-3 months). However other headphones in this budget don't even offer a mic, and others which do have sh*t audio and build quality. So I think it's a restriction to these budget gadgets. You can't expect everything at this price.

Overall I feel if the mic doesn't really bother you, then just go for it. Otherwise invest some more money and get the basshead 450 or 510. Or you can wait for the big sales as they recieve a discount of 300 and 500 respectively.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Sound:- Good enough, don't expect much at this price.

Comfort:- The comfort on this headphone is really terrible. It's way too tight for my liking and it will start to hurt around your ears when you wear it for more than an hour at a time.

All in all, 3/5 stars, don't get this headphone if you plan to use it for long periods of time every day, either you should spend more money to get a better headphone above Rs 1000 or go for a earphone at this price range.",2.0 out of 5 stars

For this device, initially for the first 2 months, all was well. After that, I had to manually hold the mic near my mouth for every call in order to get a clear audio experience. It's very sad. Also, it hurts the ear after usage of around 40 mins. This device has a very low durability. The microphone is suboptimal. The headset sound is average at best.

Bestest audio quality but worst cable qualitky due to which one ear may don't work. I personally reordered 2 times but in both headphones wire quality was worst and one ear didn't work on the first day.. When you twist the wire little bit.. Also they may say its portable but its not.. Even when walking with this headphones.. The cable somehow makes it little uncomfortable for me to walk.. So i recommend to get headphones which has blutooth.. Still I'll say.. That this has best audio quality..,3.0 out of 5 stars
"GENUINE REVIEW:----------

Just Got it... Received today.
----------------------------------------
Bass was SuperB. I am using Snapdragon Audio+ and Bass was outstanding on mobiles 🤩 BUT Laptop Output had Low Bass 😞. But the Punches and Thump i felt from the pads when playing music on mobile was great.
----------------------------------------
Pads are really soft and comfortable on the ears..
Wire Quality is Good and soft as well.

No Inner Ear pain.. I used it for 1 hour continuously, but the auricle of the ear was paining because of tight grip it gets on your head after 1 hour. 😖Loose it by stretching it up on the book.

And Lastly Jack is well built with springs on the end for long lasting.

"Headphones have become quite the necessity in these pandemic days of online existence. Whilst they might look sturdy, the majority of them end up looking the worse for wear because of the constant use and contact with sweat. they also develop all kinds of problems, such as the sound coming only through one ear, or crackling, sooner rather than later. No headphone of mine, irrespective of price, has survived for more than two years. This one was also no different. Had to discard it after two years because the sound stopped coming. Before that, there was an odd problem where the head phone took over the YouTube controls and the video would start and stop randomly. Battery life wasn't also all that great.",3.0 out of 5 stars

"Why this headphones are great!
- sound quality is great, if you are pure Bass lover and looking for a budget headphones, these are for you.
- Headphones are designed to improve Bass so, Music clarity is little less but really balanced with boosted bass.
- it's duel foldable, means can be folded in two ways and it comes real handy while traveling, fits nicely in the bag.
- headband has nice synthetic leather stitching and feels soft, comfortable on the head. Hight of head band is adjustable and quality is real good.
-Ear muffs also have synthetic leather, feels soft and great, noise cancellation is really good I can't hear any noise after putting it on.
-head phone jack is 3.5 mm full metal and not gold coated, some people are complaining about it but the brochure they provide in the box is universal it comes with every boat headphones, so that info might differ.
-head phone jack comes with this protection spring which helps it to avoid bending, and damages from bending.
- Mic quality is very good campared to other headphones in this range, I have more than 5 headphones and mic quality of this headphones beats them all.
- cable is thick and excellent quality, doesn't tangle so easily.
-i only had one problem with this headphones, I don't know if it is because my ears are so big or something else but I can't wear these for more than two hours. My ears starts paining, it's not like these are not comfortable in my ear or something. Don't know the real reason.",4.0 out of 5 stars

"-->PROS:
1.EXCELLENT SOUND CLARITY AND BASS.
2.AT 100% SOUND BASS IS MORE THAN I EXPECTED AND STUNNING QUALITY.
3.ALL MY PREVIOUS HEADSETS WORE OUT AT CONNECTOR WHICH CONNECTS 3.5MM JACK TO MOBILE OR PC,BUT THIS ONE COMES WITH METALLIC SPRING LIKE PROTECTOR (AT JOINT)WHICH PREVENTS WIRE BENDING AND WEAR AND TEAR.
4.AT FIRST I THOUGHT IT WAS SO SMALL FOR MY HEAD ,BUT LATER DISCOVERED ITS HEIGHT IS ADJUSTABLE(LAME ME) AND ITS FOLD-ABLE AND PORTABLE TOO.
5.COMES WITH ONE YEAR MANUFACTURER WARRANTY FROM BOAT.
-->CONS:
1.ITS QUITE (ALMOST) VERY TIGHT AND SQUEEZING MY EARS EVER SINCE I BOUGHT THIS ,HOPE IT WILL BECOME LOOSE IN FUTURE, IT MAKES ME STRESSED AND NOT ABLE TO WEAR MORE THAN AN HOUR SINCE NO AIR FLOW AND COMPLETELY DUMPS AIRFLOW.
2.AT SOME INSTANCES I FEEL IT VERY HEAVY TO WEAR AND CAUSE ME LOWER EAR PAIN.
3.NO VOLUME ADJUST BUTTON OR WHEEL,HAS ONLY ONE BUTTON TO ATTEND CALLS .
4.AT 100% VOLUME BASS MAKES HEADPHONES TO VIBRATE ,CAUSING ABOUT 1-3 % DISTORSION IN MUSIC(NOT VERY NOTICABLE IN ALL SONGS ONLY FEW EXCEPTIONS).",4.0 out of 5 stars

In this prize range this headphones are so nice. No other headphone are comparable. But if we compare with earphones so you can really buy a great quality earphones in this prize range which give you a lot better sound quality. For gamers in my personal opinion it's so nice and comfortable you can use it for play any game there is no sound delay or low sound problem during games but when you play songs so sound is little bit low. But also watch price ! At the end this item is so nice in this prize range.,3.0 out of 5 stars

"Firstly it has a relatively small cup size which sits over the ear. Hence you'll have bare with other sounds nearby.
Secondly, although it sounds really nice and has deep bass beats, the headphone doesn't sit properly on your head since it has long arms thereby reducing grip.

Overall it is a good deal and you can always count on boAT (be it any product for that instance).",5.0 out of 5 stars
"One bad thing is it's hurn on head, as all the caution is provided on the top instead of in the bottom , which touch head .

"I've been using this headphone for over a month. Must say, it has not just met.. it has exceeded my expectations. The sound quality is excellent. I keep the volume to minimum and can still hear the audio clearly. The mic is also working fine, no issues and people at the other end can hear me clearly. Noise cancellation is not perfect, but I'm not complaining as I was not looking out for this feature. Works well on all devices. The overall built, cable thickness and mettalic jack gives a feel that this one will last for many years!!

"Honestly, this is the first product of boat which I am not much of a fan. I used to love every product of boat until I used it. It's not like the usual boat products which give you extraordinary sound quality in the low budget price. It has cheap rate and accordingly cheap sound quality. But as usual, Boat has done an amazing work to maintain its premium build. Looks like a premium headphones. Also the bass is as usual a notable plus point of these headphones. Also unlike others said in the reviews, I don't feel any ears pain even after using them continuously for 5 hours. These are very lightweight so you don't feel any uneasiness while wearing them.
Overall it can be said if you are looking for headphones with average sound quality and great build in a low budget cost then this is perfect for you.",4.0 out of 5 stars

"This Boat Ear phone of mine stopped working in the Mid of April 2020. It did'nt strike me then to check for the warranty period due to this Covid-19 lock down. Now that I am checking the old orders, I find that its just one year since I brought this product and the warranty too is 1 year. It lasted exactly for 1 year not more not less. So the immediate question that comes to my mind is ""Is this the quality of a reputed company ""Boat"" ? I have just missed the boat by few days and that too due to this Covid-19 lockdown. Will this qualify for replacement? Please let me know.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Sound is loud and clear. Listening to music files will be a soothing experience. Although it could have even better sound quality but at this price, I don't mind what it delivers. Mic works very well too. I bought it for making calls for my business over Skype. I am using Skype on my phone to make calls and it works pretty good for me. Thanks to boat.",4.0 out of 5 stars

"It has a good sound quality for its price of Rs 800. This was my first ""headphone"" so it did taught me a few things. So lets talk about them, the only deal breaker for me was its comfort as it is an on ear headphone it does feel a lot uncomfortable even if you wear it for just 1 hour. It have realise after using these headphones that i hate on-ear headphone and *comfort is far more important aspect to consider than the sound quality* (at least for me).If you are planning to use your headphone for long hours then I don't recommend this headphone to you. If you want a comfortable headphone there are very few options at this price range, you could go for a gaming headphone as they are very comfortable due to their over the ear design if you can't extend your budget.

"If you're the kind of person who gets headaches from wearing earphones but needs music to work or focus, you might buy this because it's only 150 grams. After like 6 months of use the headphones still exert an insane amount of pressure onto your ears, and the weight barely goes to the top of your head. I've tried everything and every size but it always makes my head pain.

Plus, even when it's tight it will probably fall off when you're doing pushups or something. The button is pretty flimsy. Not recommended.",2.0 out of 5 stars
"Doesn't feel tight. As for sound quality Noise leaks, does pretty decent job but I'd rather go for Boat rockers 400/450. They cost just Inr 200 more than this and does the job better twice. With just INR 200 it gives bluetooth, removable aux(that way if the wire is damaged it can be replaced), feels tight(in a good way).

When coming to headset its just awsome for bass anf sound.The problem is with mic its just emits echo to receiver out there.But it ise not much problem for me bucause it is very little as it doesn't have a noise cancellation mic.
As it is an ON-EAR headphone it will pain of u keep it for 3-4 hrs.But it is only initial for 1month.
And it is a great headphone when comes to PUBG i assure that if u r looking for a budget buy for all purposes headphones then it suits best for u as it did for mine.
From four months i don't see a single con except for that mic echo but it will also come when u r near wind.

Pros:-
1.Best budget headphone with in line

5.Good looking

Cones:-
No cones to discuss.you can't get better headphone than this at this price segment.

I had purchased the black one at Rs749 but price keeps on changing from 749-1399 and sometimes 2199 so if want to buy this at cheaper price wait for sometime.

Old review: Its wire got damaged after 2 months of purchase. I wrote an email to claim a warranty and it had been 2 and half week now. There is no response from Boat. After sales customer service seems to be pathatic. It appears, they don't value a customer at all. If I don't get any response within a month from a warranty claim request.

Used it to watch a movie of 2 hrs continuously n no pain at all. Infact very comfortable on ears n soft cushioning. Noise cancellation is also satisfactory. Dont hear much of outside noise nor does sound leaks out to others.
Got it mainly for my son for online classes, he’s in 4th Std and fits his smaller head perfectly too with no pain or discomfort.

"After 3 days of usage
Good sound quality, decent mic, and don't need to hold mic close to mouth to sound clear for recipients.
Works quite well for MS Teams and Skype calls.

Post 3 months usage:
Mic quality has dropped down significantly. I need to hold mic close to mouth while speaking, quite frustrating and at times annoying. Didn't expect this with just a few months of usage.
Don't buy this product.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"I will come straight to the point. These are infact a great pair of headphones - but only when you are traveling or require active noise cancellation. Otherwise these are just a decent pair.

I have been using this for a while with my laptop & iPhone, for watching Netflix & Prime Video (The Audio Source is anyways brilliant) & listening to music on Prime Music, again, the audio source is great, so I have got a decent experience with the headphones, with nice bass & decent mids. But when you turn the Active noise cancellation, the experience is in a different league - You wont hear any other voice in your vicinity. I have tested this in multiple flights as well. Even if you just turn the noise cancellation on, without any music, it will give a surreal experience, you won't be able to hear any in-cabin flight noise (engines etc.) It has actually helped me have a nice in-flight experience whether to just sleep or watch any movie.

Two things which could have been improved upon are -
1. With out Noise cancellation listening experience.
2. Re chargeable inbuilt battery could have been used.",5.0 out of 5 stars

"I gave this to my 10 year old son for his online classes. He is very happy about this product. According to him, the Sound quality is very good and the headphone covers his ears comfortably. The microphone is very good. I used it and found it to be true. The cables are of good quality. Adults who got used to in-ear headphones, may find it uncomfortable to have it on the ears for a longer time. This is because , since the ears are fully covered, after half an hour or so, we start feeling the heat. But my son does not like in-ear phone as it pains for him and is also was very fragile for sudden pulls.
Overall we are happy with this product and would recommend for anyone preferring an over- head headphone!",5.0 out of 5 stars
Noice cancellation is good. Comfortable to wear. The bass is not as much as was expected. It is alike most earphones. Mike is good. The accept/reject/pause/play button responds few microseconds late. But within 1000 bucks this is a great product.,4.0 out of 5 stars

"I bought this piece of headphone in Oct last year, and after using it for over a year, I can assure the future buyers to go for it without any hesitation. In last one year, I faced no issues and it's still running great.

Pros :
1. Great body build.
2. Great durability.
3. Great bass and crystal clear sound.
4. Wire is thick and durable for longer period.

Cons.
1 only thing I kinda feed not good about it that's it wire a bit longer, which makes it bulky and kinda hard to handle. But overall it's a great purchase.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"The sound and mic quality is awesome,but if you wear it for minutes 30 minutes you will start feeling pain in ears as the raidus is small for our ears and it will start paining continuous, you can go for a headphone which has more radius and which can cover your ear completely",3.0 out of 5 stars
"I use this headphone for my work whole day and till now no complaints on the sound quality and mic as well. Build quality is great and good focus has been given on the parts which are prone to wear and tear e.g. metal cover to pin and spring for protecting wires getting broken, speakers covered with metal cover, good cladding on the wires etc. Just go for it.",5.0 out of 5 stars

"I got this headphone for 599.
the build quality of this thing is pretty good it feels solid
Bass is amazing and overall quality of the sound is also nice no doubt.

I am very satisfied with boAt's after sales services.
my Headphone got an issue with sound (unfortunately) don't worry that doesn't mean you will also have the same issue it was just a 1 in million case
so I went to service center and without asking a single question they got me replaced with another headphones.

one more thing I have to mention that you may feel discomfort after wearing the headphones for quite long, because it is slightly tight, may be eventually it will get loose.",4.0 out of 5 stars
