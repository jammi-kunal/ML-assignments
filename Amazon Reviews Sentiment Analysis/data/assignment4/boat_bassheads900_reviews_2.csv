"Bought it in Amazon Navratri sale at 699! This is the best thing in this price range. A Budget headphone like this should have two quality, sound and comfort, and it has both of them. Looks good too!! One thing, a wider over the head band would look even more beautiful but anyways, it does the job.
Note: Buy only from trusted seller like Appario or cloudtail.",4.0 out of 5 stars

The only 0.5 I took was because : i would like to say if you're going to use it for a long time period, maybe go for something else. OnLY I found it a bit tempting to wear for more than 2 hours.
Else everything is perfect cuz it's boat, come on :) this price range, this is the most gorgeous headphones I've ever had!
I totally recommend this.",5.0 out of 5 stars

"The product is really good. Great Audio quality, good bass are some its pros. The noise cancellation, however, is not that good.

However, there are two things that I didn't like about this one. The first is that It is a bit tight out of the box (as most of the reviews tell) and it starts hurting your ears after long usage.
The Second is that the extension part, when extended, is sharp and if you are one of those who tend to put their headphones around their neck when not using, believe me, the sharp edges WILL CAUSE IRRITATION.

Other than that, this is a great deal and you should definitely go for it if the cons aren't big for you.",4.0 out of 5 stars

"NEVER EVER LET THE CUSHIONING PART TOUCH ANYTHING WHILE KEEPING IT ON STRETCHING, just turn the earcups, its okay if it rests onto the metal grill/net while stretching. (Follow the image)
Regarding the tightness of the headphone, ears getting hot and hurting ears, yes these issues exist but follow stretching shown in the image, it will be bearable after a while.
Regarding sound quality : One will never get expected sound quality unless they tweak equiliser to their individual taste, which is subjective.
I use Viper4Android and it blows my listening experience.

"These headphones have good bass and sound quality at lower to medium volume.

"The headphones are very comfortable. I am able to wear it for 1-2 hours without any problems.

Sound quality for the price is quite good. And mic works very well. My conference calls are much smoother now.

I have had this for over a month now. Physical look and feel is very good.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"After 2 months of usage. The build quality is really good I can wear them confidently without fear of breaking. Bass is good and you can actually feel the thumps in your ears.

"I bought these headphones back in June 2019. And I must say I didn't expect this much at this price.

First of all, the headphones look retro, this is what I like a lot.

Sound quality is AMAZING, again, AMAZING. The mids, highs are all amazingly balanced. The bass is not too overpowering to destroy the vocals. it's just perfect. Now it's been almost 2 years, the earcups are wearing out, but the headphones still sound great. They're very durable. After 1.5 years of use, I'm starting to hear some creaking noises, but it's fine. The jack is amazing too, has a spring so the wire does break there. It's not gold plated, but in real life usage, it doesn't make any big difference. The PVC material cable is tangle free. Everything is good. Just one problem: Comfort

Now don't get me wrong. You can use these for an hour, but after that it may start hurting your ears. just put them in your neck for 2 minutes, then wear again.

Mine haven't broken yet and are still working, but I they break I'll buy them again.

I used to believe headphones with bass don't give the perfect sound of footsteps in FPS games but these headphones proved me wrong.

16th October 2019: after 10 month of use left side of headphone stop working. Don't know how to get it repaired, warranty is 1 year so looking for option to get it repaired. No support information can be seen in Amazon.

One more issue as everyone highlighted is hard on ear, ear starts paining after 30 minutes use in any conference call.

9th November 2019: I got customer care detail of boat from Google easily. I logged the complaint and received replacement in 4 weeks. I have rated it back to 5 star for it wonderful service. No follow up is required , once logged complaint someone will come to pick faulty product, details will be shared via email and sms. Same need to be checked for update.

1. Great build quality on the 3.5mm jack and overall sound quality on the headphones is pretty good for the price!
2. Great treble and rock music playback is awesome.
3. A steal at the price, VFM 10/10

When u inject in phone and increase the volume .. U see the limit of hearing if u cross the limit u ear must damage. . I didn't cross the limit and use the headphones up to 16 hrs but there is no pain . Only one thing u feel. . Your ear pressed towards face. .

Just go for this. You won't regret buying such a beautiful product at this price range. Don't listen to any negative comments here they vary from people to people according to their personal experience but overall it's a good deal. Grab it!!

(Months later)

After using this headphone for months, now I have finally started to see its true color. At the very first sight when you purchase this , you get everything work smoothly like butter but a few months later the wire gets damaged torn, streched and its elements from inside pop out without a reason. In such headphones the quality of wire is extremely poor that you do not want to talk about. I need to cover them with tapes like iam a doctor covering wounds with stitches.
so I can not experience air disturbing the sound.

"I have been using the headphones since two days and I must say I am quite impressed. By looking at the photos of the product, I thought these are huge headphones. I was equally surprised to see the small box it came in when opened the Amazon packaging. After I took it out of the box, it felt really light in weight. The build quality of the headphones is good. You don’t feel in anyway that you are holding a cheap product. The fit is really snug. Good amount of cushioning for your years. There is a little bit of cushioning for the headband too which suffices the need. About the sound quality: Listening to music felt good. Nice bass, treble is good, you can hear every sound and tune clearly. However, I felt it needed a bit more sharpness. But hey, what all can you expect from a product at this price. I used it for calls. Voice quality is good. There is a fair amount of booze cancellation on the headphones. Microphone is powerful too. Overall and excellent product for its price.

About the sound quality it is awesome. It is capable of giving the experience of my LG mini hifi system. With greater bass it is awesome.
It is really comfortable to put on ears due to soft cushion like thing provided at the earpiece. It also has a trendy look and is stylish. Sound leak was also less.

Very helpful can easily hear the words crystal clear. Long enough wire to move here and there . One of the best wired headphone .

Bass is good for me as I don't like headphones with high bass. Sound quality is good and clear. And for gamers, you can go with this headphone if you want a good positional audio. It won't give you the 7.1 surround sound feeling like Logitech G Pro, HyperX Cloud but you can surely locate the enemy with their footsteps.",5.0 out of 5 stars

"These headphones have good sound quality. But the biggest problem is the comfort level. I and my family members (a total of 4 ) cannot wear this headphones for over 15-20 minutes, after that one starts to get external ear pain, there is definitely something wrong with the design of this headphone. The sound is good, one need not go over level 10/100 in a laptop.
Ear pain after 15 minutes is the biggest problem with this headset. Overall not a very good buy at Rs.800 as I cannot return it, somehow have to live with it or give it to some kids.",3.0 out of 5 stars

"As the delivery executive handed me the package , i was like ...what??
This is not what i've ordered!!!
Bcz the box inside the packing seems so smaal that i thought i have got a wrong product .
And i was curious as well as worried to see what i have got inside the packing but as i opened the amazons plastic packing ....boom!!
I was glad to see that i've got the right product which i have ordered ,The Boat Bassheads 900 ""the bass beast of this range"".
This product is just amazing and the sound is clear on full volume and the bass is lit💥💥infact when i play music on full volume the earcups are a bit shaking n i can feel it in my ears n yesss ...the box was small because the headphones are foldable and becomes much compact to be carried around while travelling, n the build quality is also great!
Thank you Amazon and Thank you Boat.❤️",5.0 out of 5 stars

Again another great boat product for its price. Bass could be better (if you are looking more for that). But over great music output. Build quality could be more better I guess looks a bit fragile (like it might crack if dropped from a height or something) But I have had no complaints from boat so far😄😄😄.,4.0 out of 5 stars

Boat provides us with the best products at a reasonable rate. I bought them just for my evening walks but now i think I'm gonna switch to them. Only flaw is that the cushions are not much comfortable. I was confused between these and Skullcandy anti headphones. But i ended up buying them because of the microphone. I don't think this isn't worth it.,4.0 out of 5 stars

Good quality,5.0 out of 5 stars
A great value for money. The bass is clear and prominent but not so overpowering as to drown the other frequencies. This headphone is a reasonable balance between a booming sound and mid-range frequencies. The build is also solid and what I liked most was the metal spring support provided for the wire at the jack connections.so as to prevent the wire from splitting up. The ear cups have so far withstood the sweat test and I believe will outlive the more expensive Bose headphone cups. The only drawback I see with this headphone is its slightly higher weight compared to the prohibitively expensive high end Bose headphones. But then u don't have to burn a big hole in your pocket for this headset.,4.0 out of 5 stars
