"Its just fine and has lifespan of 1 year only but not great as after 1 year the mic of this headphone stopped working and since the warranty was of 1 year so now it has become somewhat garbage for me. I only use it when I have to listen something , you can't use it for any meeting or zoom call cause when you speak thru these headphones you won't be audible. üëéüëé",4.0 out of 5 stars
"For this price point ,this headphone is a great steal.I have been using this headphone on a daily basis for more than 18 months now and I didn't expect this to last this long,given its price.It has great sounds and bass,treble is a bit high but overall the sound is great.The only con is that it's uncomfortable to wear beyond 15 mins .You cannot wear it without your ears getting hot.Apart from that,great product!",4.0 out of 5 stars

Best,4.0 out of 5 stars
"Cons:
1. This is definitely not a bass head set, it's low medium bass.
2. This is more a treble responsive headset
3. Further this is not an Active noise cancellation headset, infact no lt even noise isolation headset.
4. The bass response is aggressive on certain mid to high frequency bass range which gives a pretty harsh thud on your ear.
5. I have a low end 10 driver BA, which is atleast 10 times better with bass and noise isolation..

Pros
1. Pretty cheap on Amazon in the pricing (pocket friendly)
2. The metal connector with spring is premium quality.
3. The overall product build and feel is premium.
4. The mic is pretty responsive and works well.
5. It can be used for long conf calls as the material is soft on the outer ear and it's adjustable.
6 the gauge of wire used is extremely thick and tangle free which is great at this price.
7 There is no noise induced by brushing the wire against fabric or ones body which is a plus.",4.0 out of 5 stars

"Im going to give a small comparison of this product with two of the headphones i have been using recently.
This includes Samsung level u ( rs 2249/) and the ant audio w56 in ear wired earphone ( rs 599/)
Pros
Decent build quality
Excellent sound quality
Apt for watching movies.
Soft cushioning
Mic
Good quality cable
Cons
External noices creeps in a lot ( less noice cancellation effect).
Jack is not gold plated, but I won't complain about it because the gold plating on most of the jacks of headphones in this price range will wear off after a months usage.

On comparing the boat bass heads 900 with the ones mentioned above, I noticed that the bass levels were pretty much equal between the ant audio w56 and boat bass heads 900. Samsung level u has the least bass compared to the other 2
In terms of audio quality, the boat bass heads and Samsung level u are in the same level, the clarity of sound is a bit less in the ant audio w56 compared to the boat .
For outdoor use, I would prefer the ant audio w56 as it has better noice cancellation compared to the boat.
Comfort
I have read some reviews complaining about the boat bass heads 900 that it pains in the ears after a few minutes of usage. But I have not experienced such problems.
Build quality
The plastics used is not the best, but acceptable. Ear pads are well cushioned.
Summary
Overall a really decent product from boat, excellent sound clarity and good bass makes it good for watching movies. Most suitable for indoor usage, good value for money ( bought it for 799 but will be available for 599 at certain times.)
Audio quality 4/5
Bass 3.8/5
Value for money 4/5
Comfort 4/5
Build quality 3.7/5
Thank you for your time.",4.0 out of 5 stars

"First thing you like about this headphone is its appearance. It looks good. For the price sound quality too is decent. Good for everyday use in your home. I opted for it because wired headphones do not require charging at all. Frequent charging of wireless headphones is an everyday issue. I wish if the wire was a little longer to enable me to keep my mobile easily at a distance. For its price good product. Of course, the company should work on improving sound quality further and introduce new colours in the wired headphone segment.",4.0 out of 5 stars

"Hey everyone! I received this headphone last day, I also own a few other headphones Like boat rockerz 600, bassheads 800, creative outlier and brainwavz HM2. I personally prefer headphones to be as comfortable and good sounding as possible ,Well the comfort comes first for me.

After using many headphones ,I have to say ,Bassheads 900 is by far the most comfortable headphones I have owned. These are very lightweight and the padding is very soft. Well that's the advantage of buying an Open Back Headphone.

‚óè‚óèWHY IT'S A REALLY GOOD DEAL?‚óè‚óè
- It selling for Just 800 INR.
- The most comfortable to wear headphones I have owned.
- They are very light, but not in a bad way.
- Amazingly it comes with 2 yrs of warranty (wow)
- Build quality is good.
- Sleek, simple, matte, compact. You can‚Äôt go wrong with simple and sweet.
- Plastic used isn't that premium, but acceptable for the price.
- Foldable ,so it's super portable
- Good quality cord and spring like reinforcement at the 3.5mm jack end
- Very pleasant sound with punchy bass and no distortion.
- Offers snug fit
- Expandable to fit larger heads
- Synthetic leather padding
- can get really loud
- In-line microphone with multifunction button

‚óè‚óèWHY IT'S NOT A GOOD DEAL?‚óè‚óè
- At this price point I can't find anything which should be seen as a con.

‚óè‚óèSOUND QUALITY‚óè‚óè
These aren't that aggressive in bass as claimed by the brand ,It is rather a well balanced headphone with bass .The 40mm driver does produce good bass ,but it ain't overpowering, And I really like the sound it produces .It stays very clean and crisp in the mids. Treble sounds very pleasant .I tried listening to some pop music and Yes ,these are perfect for that. Surely you can't compare it with other expensive headphones but for the price I am totally satisfied. I tried listening to ""I'm the one"" by DJ khaled and ""Believer"" by Imagine dragon, the bass feels so good that you will get goosebumps at higher volumes.

Comparing it with boat rockerz 600 , the sound in 600 sounds much live or vivid .The bass is same but the highs and mids are more clear and accurate in basshead 900. When compared with bassheads 800, these are surely better in every way. Anyway you wouldn't find anything which sounds better than bassheads 900 below 900rs.

‚óè‚óèIS OPEN BACK HEADPHONE THE PERFECT CHOICE ?‚óè‚óè
- Well as I said ,open back type headphones are generally considering more comfortable to wear and of course sounds more realistic and live. The downside to open-back is probably obvious: everyone can hear what you‚Äôre listening to (only at higher volumes), and any ambient sound gets right in and mixes with your music.(Only if you are in a really crowded and noisy place)

The benefit, though, is some of that sound that‚Äôs headed out towards the world also gets mixed in with your music. The result is the headphone sounds significantly larger than closed-back headphones. More ‚Äúopen‚Äù sounding. Less like music beamed into your head, and more like music in a room. In other words, potentially more realistic.

‚óè‚óèMIC‚óè‚óè
There is an inbuilt mic in this headphone and it works perfectly.It will get the job done perfectly if you want to answer calls with this headphone.And yes ,it also consists of a small Inline multi function button. Which as usual can be used to answer calls ,play or pause music and skip tracks.

‚óè‚óèNoise Cancellation‚óè‚óè
This comes down to the size again. Because the headphones do not fully envelope the ear, and rather rest upon the ear, they are not capable of fully muting external noise. These headphones do a pretty decent job at tuning out the world around you however, but it is usually due more to their loudness than their actual noise elimination.

‚óè‚óèFinal Verdict‚óè‚óè
For the price, it's absolutely one of the best products I've had the pleasure of using. They sport a modern and minimal design and sound quality is remarkable. Sure, the latest pair of top-of-the-line headphones will probably sound quite a bit better than these, but again - consider the price and you'll be in awe of their performance. Absolute joy to use.

Thanks for reading my review. I hope it helps.

"If You Are Looking Headphones For Long Term Usage Kindly Go For JBL, Sony Or Other Brands They Might Be A Little Costly But It Would Be An One Time Purchase.

"Hey guys,
(This review is after 7 days usage)
I had purchased boAt Bassheads 900 Wired On Ear Headphones with Mic (Carbon Black) and the boAt Bassheads 900 Wired On Ear Headphones with Mic (Pearl White) 7 days ago for 749 and 799 respectively.

Pros
1. For the price, these headphones are a bang with amazing bass.
2. Very comfortable and has a pretty strong head band with soft leather cushion.
3. The one side wire design is so helpful, especially when you go out for a walk.
4. Fits snuggly (not too tight not too loose) and doesn't fall off that easily.
5. When you put it on your ears (even without music), the person who is talking to you, in the same room, will have to yell for you to hear them; so that's a blessing if you have to study for long hours and you want absolutely no one to disturb you.
6. Very easy to store, as the ear cups bend inwards.
7. Works on all devices.
8. The leather quality of the earcups and head band are very good.

Cons
1. Since I have glasses, the frame of my glasses is always behind my ear and for long durations of usage of the headphones, it does hurt until you get used to it.
2. For video or audio calls, you should be in a quiet room and not below the fan directly as those sounds are louder than you (the speaker).
3. Need to use at at least 75% volume to feel the effect of the song.
4. The springs of the ear cups are pretty loose on purpose to give you the snuggle fit (can be a pro or con).

P.S. the white looks much better than the black if you can maintain the whiteness for long.

These are the pros and cons I found with 7 days experience.

"I wanted to get a wired Headphone and chose this (since I already had a Bassheads 900 and liked that one).

This one is definitely more comfortable for extended usage (size of the ear cup and the comfort, both are good). Happy with the sound quality for my use.

Only downside is the wire lenght. It's too short (considering how long the 900's was). But for that, will recommend the product.

Hope boAt introduces more models in the wired range.",4.0 out of 5 stars

During call, mike is working good oposite person can hear our voice fine. But some dizzling and cracking sound is coming from the speakers during phone call. Due to this problem i am giving 4 star but for music point of view I'll give 5/5.

"Probably the best headphone in the market for under Rs. 1k as of now.
Build quality is as one would expect from a budget headphone, but i have definitely seen worst even at around Rs 1000 category. Ear coushions are ok, not as soft as i would prefer them to be, but on bad either. The mai issue if you ask me is that the headphones are little lose on the head, and no, i dont have a small head, i have average head size, i would have liked it a little bit tighter.
Coming to sound quality, as i said before, these are the best headphones under the 1k price category. But you should not forget that these costs 600 inr only. So dont go expecting the sound output like that of good lower end headphones which costs Rs. 2000+. The lows and mids are decent, but as you increase the volume, you can feel the just a little bit of distortion and at full volume, you can tell that base is overpowering the treble but that too is not as clwar as you would like it to be. But then again, you can not get anything better in under 1k price category.
So yeah, if your budget is under 1k and you are fine with a wired on-ear headphone and has a slightly bigger head, then this is the only choice for you as of now.",3.0 out of 5 stars

BOUGHT IF FOR 599 INR
writting review after 1 day usage
had used many boat products before

#PROS:--
*sound quality is best in this price range (5/5)
highs are very crisp , mids are clear, but lows are
almost killed due to addition of extra bass.
*build quality is descent nothing too special or
fancy , specially it is light weight still feels solid
*3.5 mm Jack is made up of metal and comes with a
spring and spring prevents it from breaking wire in
long term rough use
*padding is ok can wear it for 1 to 1.5 hrs after that
ears starts to pain.

# major CONS :--
* THE VERY SERIOUS ISSUE IS THAT WHEN U PLAY
MUSIC THE SOUND LEAKS OUTSIDE
i mean if very less sound is leaked then its ok but it
is extremlu loud even it can be annoying to u as
anyone sitting beside you can hear what r u
listening . for refrence u can take u r playing musuc
with your phone at volume at 2 level with ur
phone's speaker than the sound u hear is as same
as the sound leaked from headphones.

*as they are on ear headphones they r not too
comfortable specially for long time of continuous
use . So if uh spend more than 2 hrs. continuously
then better add some more money and get over
ear headphones

# minor CONS :--
*3.5 mm Jack is not gold plated
*no bearded or kevelar cable like usb cable and aux
cable made by boat, its just plastic with ok quality
*the microphone button is very tight/hard to press
and requires a bit of extra force which is annoying
*their is no seal on box (this is not only my case )for
this headphones u never get seal on box . Common
boat wtf is this its just a piece of tape .
*if u wear galsses then u should have to remove
them as the frame of glasses sits behing ur ear and
the headphones apply inward pressure on ur ear so
ur ear may start to pain due to glasses

I HOPE IN NEST VERSON OF PRODUCT BOAT WILL FOX THEASE ISSUES

I bought this headphones for ‚Çπ549. And it is worth for money,5.0 out of 5 stars
"I've been using these for a little over 2 weeks. Not regularly, but often enough. To note, I really like boAt products having used them over last 3 years, first with RockerZ Bluetooth headphones, then the basic wired ones and now this and this would be my first time using over the ear headphones. Here is my review

Pros :
- Price point (for sale at ‚Çπ599)
- strong and very durable jack
- with mic
- long cable for convenience
- can be compacted into a small carrying size, as shown in image
- definitely has got strong noise cancellation and high bass, however, if one is not used to it (like myself) it can be annoying at times

"If you don't wanna read my thoughts about these headphones, I have written OVERALL CONCLUSION at the bottom for those who just wanna get to the point of my review.

I cannot say this one of the best headphones I have ever heard. But for the price I can say this is a very good value for money headphone. But if you are like me, an audiophile obsessed with high quality stuff. Then these headphones would not really impress you.

However, I WOULD say these headphones have a Bass much higher than headphones I have heard even than the Sony MDR-XB450 EXTRA BASS.
I can tell you one thing, if you listen to bass heavy and don't really mind a sound quality that may sound bellow average, then these headphones would satisfy you very much!

I wouldn't recommend using these headphones on a phone unless your phone has a very good DAC, which basically means a good sound card, which would give you the best out of these headphones.

However, let me explain why exactly I feel these headphones could have been better. The main thing is the sound quality. I could hear some vocals getting a bit underwhelmed, and the overall quality of the sound wasn't too good. Now I'm not saying thats unacceptable considering the price. For the price these headphones would definitely blow you away.
But I bought these headphones as a spare, portable and durable solution for video editing. Now I am disappointed by the overall sound quality, but they do the job well enough, and I cannot complain about the bass. The bass in these headphones are absolutely incredible and almost a steal for this price.
The 40mm drivers allow the sound of these headphones to sound much wider and more fuller than you would get in a pair of earphones.

OVERALL CONCLUSION:

Buy these headphones if you want amazing vibrating incredible thumping bass. Good portability since this headphone folds up which is a nice feature. It has good build quality, and feels very sturdy, has an in-built microphone and has decent level of noise isolation/comfort.

Overall - a very good buy for the price you pay, and a steal price if you are a bass lover.

***Remember that you WILL need an AMP or a good in-built sound card in your device in order to get the best out of these headphones. ***",4.0 out of 5 stars

"Very good quality for the price range. The sound and the mike quality is good. I use it on my laptop for work purpose, talking to my team on Google Hangouts or Microsoft Team.

Pros:
1. The sound and mike quality is good. This was the main purpose of buying this headphone.
2. The springs attached at the end of the pin, helps pull out the wire in case it gets pulled. This is really helpful.
3. The cable is pretty long

Cons: None

Small concern: On long usage I experience some discomfort on my ears and have to remove the headset for a while. But it is an indicator how snugly it fits over your ears.

The best one perhaps in this price range.

"Bass is amazing although mids does sound a bit muddy. I like the wire and build quality and for 600 cant get better than that. Good for listening music/videos etc.
However, what is the point when you cant wear these for more than 30 mins!! My ear starts paining especially left earlobe coz of these headphones. Seems like a design fault, as they swivel towards outside than inside. This creates a less flexible option when you wear it. So trying to use left side on right ear and right side on left ear. That has sorted the issue a bit!
Good for 20 to 30 mins music.. Dont try it for playing games... Your earlobes will hurt and pain.. Plus using the opposite sides of left/right of headphones to ease pain... will cause immense confusion of footsteps in games!!",4.0 out of 5 stars

"(Ok so, headphones you buy should be based on who you are (music producer, audio engineer, DJ or a regular person).
For non-music produces (normal people):
This headphone is ideal for you. Please don't go for studio-quality or expensive headphones for only listening to music (because expensive headphones are for music producers and require a huge amount of power that can't be used with mobile). It comes with a small microphone in one of the wires, is foldable (easy to store even in small bags). BUT, the ear cups are really small to my ears, get heated quickly, so you can't wear it for a long time comfortably. This headphone can be used with all devices and doesn't need a lot of power like the expensive ones. And if you listen to podcasts, I don't recommend it because it is uncomfortable to wear and has bad noise cancellation feature. But if you use headphones for meetings and listening to music, this is perfect for you.

For music producers and mixing engineers:
I do not recommend these headphones for you. Because if we see the frequency response, it plays sounds from 20-10000 Hz (as far as I can hear). But it plays bass sounds more than other frequencies which can make you biased and wrong decisions while making music and mixing/mastering. Anywhen it comes to power, it is 80 ohms. So please don‚Äôt buy ANY cheap headphones for music producing and I recommend buying headphones that have frequency response clearly mentioned (20Hz to 20000Hz is good) with 250 ohms. Such studio-quality headphones are not cheap though. You can see more studio-quality headphone suggestions for producer s on YouTube.
Hope this helps :)",3.0 out of 5 stars

"Okay, let's start by saying that you will not get anything like this at this price point. Considering that, this headphone can be easily used for video calls, it's actually pretty great for this which is my primary use case for it. Vocals sound a teeny tiny bit heavy or boom-y, because a large part of the spectrum that it can cover is occupied by very heavy, and not pleasing bass. But you wouldn't notice it if this is your only pair of headphones or if you are not used to better headphones/earphones.

Coming to music, unless you're a total basshead, you wouldn't be able to tolerate the boominess of it, there's too much of base at every frequency of its very limited spectrum, and honestly it gets very tiring after a while because of the heavy bass. This fact is compounded by the fact that these are NOT, I repeat, NOT comfortable, especially if you're wearing glasses with thick handles, even considering the adjustments you can make to make it fit better. There is a remedy however, mentioned by another reviewer. Use a book or anything and put the headphones over the book, for a day or two, and it should loosen up enough for you to wear, for a longer duration.

Having said all that, I don't listen to music, neither watch movies with this thing on. I only use this for video conferencing, and apart from the headache I got from the tightness of the headphones, I am VERY satisfied with the product. It actually becomes usable after it's loose enough without your head exploding. It is very cheap, and honestly, there's nothing like it out there at this price. You can usually find it for Rs. 800-900, don't buy it for a higher price, NOT worth it. Ciao!",3.0 out of 5 stars
